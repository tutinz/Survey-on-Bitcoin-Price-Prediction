# Survey on Bitcoin Price Prediction

This repository contains materials for a survey on Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning models. It includes:
- Three tables summarizing the analyzed papers.
- A Python notebook for detailed analysis of the collected data.

## Contents

- `tab0BTCSurvey.csv`: First table summarizing key aspects of the analyzed papers.
- `tab1BTCSurvey.csv`: Second table with additional details on data sources and methods.
- `tab2BTCSurvey.csv`: Third table focusing on features used in prediction models.
- `surveyBitcoinPricePrediction.ipynb`: Python notebook analyzing the data from the three tables.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Survey-on-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction.git
2. Ensure all files (tab0BTCSurvey.csv, tab1BTCSurvey.csv, tab2BTCSurvey.csv, and surveyBitcoinPricePrediction.ipynb) are in the same directory.
3. Open the Python notebook (surveyBitcoinPricePrediction.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis.
4. The notebook uses the three tables as input for statistical analysis and insights generation related to Bitcoin price prediction.
